Our community enables [UEFI]({{wiki}}/UEFI){:target="_blank"} firmware and tools through various open source projects. Most of our efforts are currently related to the [EDK II]({{baseurl}}/edk2/) project, so if you are developer, then this is a good place to start contributing to our community.

UEFI developers are the primary focus of our community, but if you are interested in trying to use UEFI, then we have a page on how to [start using UEFI]({{wiki}}/Start-using-UEFI){:target="_blank"}.
	
There are several ways to participate in our community. Anyone can join our [Mailing Lists]({{wiki}}/Mailing-Lists){:target="_blank"} to discuss UEFI related topics.
